    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These baked beans with bacon are the easiest recipe to make. I doctor up canned baked beans with apple and brown sugar to make them sticky and sweet.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 slices bacon</li>
        <li>2 (16 ounce) cans baked beans</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 Granny Smith apple - peeled, cored and diced</li>
        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>¼ cup yellow mustard</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until much of the grease has been released, but bacon is still flexible. Drain on paper towels and set aside.</li>
        <li>Stir together baked beans, onion, apple, brown sugar, ketchup, and mustard in a 9-inch square baking dish until well combined. Top with bacon slices.</li>
        <li>Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until bacon is crisp and beans are bubbling hot, about 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
