    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Zucchini lasagna is an ideal low-carbs dinner to satisfy your Italian food craving. It's perfect in the summer with garden-fresh veggies and herbs, or in the winter when you need a comforting meal. You won't even miss the noodles in this one!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Zucchini: Of course, you will need zucchini! Two large zucchini should make enough for eight servings.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: This zucchini lasagna is seasoned with salt, pepper, fresh basil, fresh oregano, and fresh parsley.</li>
        <li>Beef: This recipe calls for ground beef, but you can use ground turkey for a lighter take.</li>
        <li>Fresh produce: Aside from the zucchini, you will also need a green bell pepper, an onion, and mushrooms from the produce aisle.</li>
        <li>Frozen spinach: Frozen spinach is a convenient, colorful, and nutrient-rich ingredient.</li>
        <li>Tomato products: A combination tomato paste and tomato sauce.</li>
        <li>Wine: Red wine enhances the overall flavor.</li>
        <li>Cheese: You will need low-fat ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg adds moisture and helps bind the ricotta mixture together, preventing runniness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a deep 9x13-inch baking pan.</li>
        <li>Slice zucchini lengthwise into very thin slices. Sprinkle slices lightly with salt; set aside to drain in a colander.</li>
        <li>To prepare the meat sauce, cook ground beef and black pepper in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add green pepper and onion; cook and stir until meat is no longer pink.</li>
        <li>Stir in tomato sauce, tomato paste, wine, basil, and oregano; add a small amount of hot water if sauce is too thick. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer sauce for about 20 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, stir ricotta, egg, and parsley together in a bowl until well combined.</li>
        <li>To assemble lasagna, spread 1/2 of the meat sauce over the bottom of the prepared pan. Layer with 1/2 of the zucchini slices, 1/2 of the ricotta mixture, all of the spinach, followed by all of the mushrooms, then 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat by layering in the remaining meat sauce, zucchini slices, ricotta mixture, and mozzarella. Spread Parmesan evenly over the top; cover with foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove foil; raise oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake an additional 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let lasagna stand 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
